# snailscheme

- Need to understand `reservedOp`

## Comments on book

- Avoid discussing things like GADT and Monad Transformers
- More practical exercises with solutions
- Possible improvements to naming, e.g. `IFunc` (not sure what 'I' is here,
  maybe interface) and `Atom` (possible symbol?)
- Use scheme standards wherever possible, e.g. single/multiline comments
- More of a "X in Action" style where you start from scratch and don't rely on
  the reference implementation
- Reference implementation should be commented heavily
  - Maybe we can just use https://github.com/Kleidukos/Intrigue? This is R5RS
    but maybe the reference implementation should be the simple variant only
